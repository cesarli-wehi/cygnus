### MOTTO

The phrase “**_scientia potentia est_**” (or “**_scientia est potentia_**” or also “**_scientia potestas est_**“) is a Latin aphorism meaning “knowledge is power”. It is commonly attributed to [Sir Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Francis_Bacon), although there is no known occurrence of this precise phrase in Bacon’s English or Latin writings. However, the expression “_ipsa scientia potestas est_” (‘knowledge itself is power’) occurs in Bacon’s _Meditationes Sacrae_ (1597). The exact phrase “_scientia potentia est”_ was written for the first time in the 1668 version of the work [_Leviathan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)) by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes), who was secretary to Bacon as a young man.

The related phrase “_sapientia est potentia”_ is often translated as “wisdom is power”.
